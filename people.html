                <h3>Economic</h3>
                Food waste has significant economic impacts on both individual households 
                and entire countries. <mark class="red">Wasted food represents lost income for 
                farmers, food processors, and retailers.</mark> It also leads to 
                increased costs for waste disposal and contributes to 
                higher food prices. On an individual level, wasting food is 
                essentially throwing away money.
              </div>
              <div class="col">
                <h3>Environmental</h3>
                Food waste has a major impact on the environment, contributing to 
                climate change and other environmental problems. 
                It is responsible for the production of greenhouse gases, 
                the use of land and water resources, and the pollution of air,
                 water, and soil. <mark class="red">Reducing food waste can help to mitigate 
                 some of these environmental impacts.</mark>
              </div>
              <div class="col">
                <h3>Hunger&Poverty</h3>
                Food waste contributes significantly to hunger and poverty in the world. 
                With <mark class="red">9% of the global population suffering from chronic hunger</mark>, and over 690 million people not 
                having enough food to eat, the amount of food that is wasted could potentially solve the problem
                 of hunger in the world. The social and economic cost of hunger and malnutrition is immense, 
                 with an estimated cost of <mark class="red">Â£2.8 trillion per year in lost productivity and healthcare costs</mark>.

            <div class="row" style="margin-top: 10vh;">
              <div class="col">
                <h3>Social Justice</h3>
                Food waste has significant social and humanitarian impacts, particularly in low-income communities.
                <mark class="red">Food insecurity and hunger remain major problems in many 
                 parts of the world,</mark> and reducing food waste could help to 
                 alleviate these problems. Additionally, food waste has 
                 negative impacts on food banks and other organizations 
                 that work to provide food to those in need.
              </div>
              <div class="col">
                <h3>Health</h3>
                Food waste has a negative impact on public health, particularly in low-income communities. The
                consumption of spoiled or contaminated food can lead to
                 foodborne illnesses and other health problems. 
                 Additionally, the <mark class="red">overproduction of food can lead to the 
                 use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals </mark>that can 
                 have negative impacts on human health.
              </div>
              <div class="col">
                <h3>Ethics</h3>
                Wasting food raises ethical and moral questions about the distribution of resources and the 
                treatment of people and animals involved in food production. When food is wasted, it is 
                essentially taking resources away from those who need it. Additionally, <mark class="red">food waste can contribute to overproduction,
                 leading to issues such as overfishing and deforestation.</mark>
